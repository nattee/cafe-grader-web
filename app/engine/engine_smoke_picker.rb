# Chooses the submission that `bin/rails engine:smoke SUB=auto` regrades on
# this host — the post-deploy grading check the deploy pipeline runs before it
# restarts anything (2026-09-17; the gap it closes is how rev 2045 reached nine
# servers, see doc/backlog.md Resolved). Submission ids differ per host, so a
# hard-coded SUB= would be right on one server and wrong on eight; this picks
# from the host's own data instead.
#
# The rules exist to make a non-zero EngineSmoke exit trustworthy, i.e. a real
# engine fault and not the submission's own quirks:
#   - done, regular (not a near-miss shadow), non-viva, full score — so the run
#     crosses compile, every testcase through the checker, and the scorer;
#   - one of LANGUAGE_ORDER, tried in that order — every judge host compiles
#     C++, most C and Python; nothing else is guaranteed anywhere;
#   - slowest testcase used at most RUNTIME_MARGIN of the time limit — a timing
#     wobble cannot flip P<->T and give a false "verdict DIFFERS";
#   - graded after the live dataset and its testcases last changed — the stored
#     grade really is against the dataset the run will use;
#   - testcases x time_limit within MAX_BUDGET_SECONDS — the check stays cheap
#     (fleet runs took 2-20 s on 2026-08-30);
#   - most recent first — a recent submission's testcase files are still on
#     disk, which is not true of every old dataset on every host.
