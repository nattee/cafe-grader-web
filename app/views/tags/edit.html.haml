            #### Tags

            Tags are a way to mark a problem with customizable badge. For example, we can use tags to mark topic of a problem. 
            A problem can have multiple tags. If a tag is **public**, the tag is shown, under the problem name, to users in the main page.
            A tag can also be set as a **primary**. All primary tags are display for filtering problem in the main page.

            Example uses cases is using primary tags to mark a chapter or a class that the problem belongs to while using 
            public tags to mark detailed topic of the problem.
