# Brute-force protection shared by the two password doors — the web login
# (LoginController#login) and the API login (Api::V1::AuthController#login).
# The cache keys are door-agnostic, so attempts through either door draw
# down the same budget; throttling only one door would just redirect the
# attack to the other.
#
# Only *failures* count: a NAT'd classroom logging in at once must never
# trip the per-IP counter, so successes cost nothing. The per-account
# counter stops a distributed attack on one account; the per-IP counter
# stops spraying many accounts from one host. A throttled request is
# refused before any password check, so it can't be used as an oracle and
# never reaches external authenticators (CUCAS).
#
# FAILURE_LIMIT sits well above real frustrated-human burst rates observed
# at exam starts (~20 attempts in 2-3 minutes). The window is fixed, not
# sliding: Rails' cache stores keep the first failure's expiry when they
# increment, so a counter dies WINDOW after its first failure and a lock
# lasts at most the rest of that window. No permanent per-account lockout
# on purpose — that would let anyone lock a victim out of an exam by
# hammering their login name.
#
# Exam gateways: when a whole room reaches the server through one NAT
# address (the exam environment's VPN gateway), every student's typo lands
# on one per-IP counter, and a few minutes of wrong passwords lock the room
# out (DS Quiz 2, 2026-10-07: a CU-net password switch left off for four
# minutes, 113 login attempts refused). Addresses listed in
# right.login_throttle_exempt_ips skip the per-IP counter; the per-account
# counter still applies to them. Admins clear live locks with "Clear Login
# Locks" on the configuration page (LoginThrottling.clear_recent!).
