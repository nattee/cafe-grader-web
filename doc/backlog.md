# Backlog

Design refactors, deferred decisions, and "someday" follow-ups that don't yet
warrant a GitHub issue or fit in a single TODO comment. Each entry should be
short — title, why it matters, current state, proposed direction, rough size.
Trim or move to an issue when you start the work.

Conventions:
- One section per entry. Keep them grep-able.
- Cite file paths so the next reader (or Claude) can jump in cold.
- Don't put per-commit TODOs here — those go inline as `# TODO(scope): …`.
- Don't put scheduled or assigned work here — that goes on GitHub.
- When an entry is resolved, cut it to a pointer block (what shipped, rev, where
  the durable record lives, any residual) and move it to the `## Resolved` ledger
  at the bottom, newest first. The full write-up stays in `hg log`, the CHANGELOG
  and the linked docs.
- An entry we have decided NOT to do until something specific happens goes under
  `## Waiting for a signal`, with an explicit **Reopen when:** line. That is a
  different state from low priority: the work is understood and often designed,
  but there is no evidence or requirement yet that it is wanted. Don't start one
  without its signal; do move it back up the moment the signal appears.

## Viva grade history — make "regrade" a feature instead of a script

**Raised 2026-09-09 after the Quiz 1 Cell Detection regrade** (done by hand with
`course-prep/…/regrade-cell-detection-2026-09-09/tools/regrade_tool.rb`; record in
`doc/Viva-History.md` 2026-09-09). `viva_grades` is one row per submission (unique
index) and the admin **Re-run grading** button destroys it, so the app keeps no
grade history and a batch regrade needs an external snapshot to be reversible.
`viva_grades.rubric_version` exists and is never written.

Proposed: `superseded_at` on `viva_grades` (index becomes non-unique; `has_one
:viva_grade, -> { where(superseded_at: nil) }` + `has_many :viva_grades`); write
`rubric_version` = sha256 of the briefing at grading time; the Re-run button and a
new `bin/rails viva:regrade PROBLEM=<name> [MODEL=…] [NEVER_LOWER=1] [APPLY=1]`
supersede instead of destroy; the admin viva page lists earlier grades. The
never-lower rule keeps the whole higher record (points + breakdown + narrative),
as decided 2026-09-09. Rough size: 1–2 days incl. migration, tests, docs.

## Memory accounting for C/C++ — address space vs cgroup (POLICY + a real bug)

**Raised 2026-08-03 from the CMS migration validation.** Three separate things
are tangled here; separating them makes the decision much easier.

### The mechanics (verified on both sides)

Both graders run isolate. Cafe passes `-m <KB>` for C/C++ → **RLIMIT_AS**, which
caps *address space*: everything the process maps, including memory reserved and
never touched. CMS passes `--cg-mem` → **cgroup accounting**, which caps pages
actually faulted in (RSS).

Concretely: a global `int dp[5000][5000]` is 100 MB of address space the instant
the binary maps its BSS, so cafe kills it at startup even if the solution touches
2 MB. Under cgroups the untouched pages cost ~nothing and it runs. Cafe fails on
*declaration*; CMS fails on *use*.

Cafe already uses cgroups for java/digital/go/python
(`app/engine/judge_base.rb#isolate_need_cg_by_lang`) — C/C++ are the exception.
isolate supports **both** flags simultaneously (`-m` and `--cg-mem` are separate
options), which enables the hybrid below.

### Issue 1 — POLICY: should unused declared memory count? (legitimate either way)

**Cafe style (address space) — for:**
- Deterministic: the verdict never depends on which testcase or how much of the
  array gets touched. Same program, same verdict, every run.
- Teaches memory discipline explicitly: "your solution must FIT in 256 MB" is a
  real competitive-programming skill, and declaring `MAXN` far beyond the limit
  is caught immediately rather than tolerated.
- Prevents lucky passes: a solution declaring 1 GB but touching little passes the
  given tests under cgroups, then dies on data that touches more. Address-space
  limiting rejects it consistently.
- Fails fast (cheaper to grade).

**Cafe style — against:**
- Counts things the student does not control: the static binary's mappings,
  allocator arenas, thread stacks, libstdc++'s own reservations. A solution
  genuinely using 50 MB can show substantially more address space.
- Penalises a widely-taught idiom (declare `dp[MAXN][MAXN]`, use a submatrix).
- Diverges from IOI / CMS / Codeforces, where limits are RSS-based. Students
  trained elsewhere — and problems authored elsewhere — assume the other model.
- Linux over-commits by default, so reserved-but-untouched memory costs the
  machine nothing; the limit measures something that is not a real resource cost.

**cgroup style — for:** measures what the machine actually pays; matches the
convention every imported problem was authored against; enables correct MLE
reporting (see Issue 2). **Against:** allows declare-huge-touch-little
solutions to pass; verdict can vary by testcase; may count page cache for files
the sandbox reads (needs testing on large-input tasks).

### Issue 2 — A BUG, independent of the policy choice

```
Evaluation.count                          6,922,221
Evaluation.where(result: :memory_limit)           0     <-- never, not once
Evaluation.where(result: :crash)            555,119     (8.0%)
```

**Cafe has never once reported "memory limit exceeded" for C/C++.** Under
`RLIMIT_AS`, an over-limit allocation makes `malloc` return NULL or throw
`bad_alloc`; the process dies by signal and isolate reports a runtime error, so
cafe records `crash` (`x`). Students exceeding memory are told their program
crashed — indistinguishable from a segfault. isolate can only report a genuine
memory-limit kill through cgroup accounting (`cg-oom-killed`), so **accurate MLE
verdicts require cgroups regardless of which policy is chosen for the limit.**

### Issue 3 — Imported CMS problems are effectively stricter than authored

Their `memory_limit` values were calibrated against RSS semantics. Enforced as
address space, the same number is a tighter budget, so students lose points they
earned on the source instance. Measured in the migration sweep: submissions CMS
scored 100 scored **0** here; enabling cgroups took two affected tasks from 8-9/10
to **10/10 exact** (`doc/CMS-Migration.md` §5.1).

### Measured behaviour (isolate experiments, 2026-08-03)

**How RSS/cgroup accounting actually charges.** A program declaring a 1 GiB
global array, touching the first 64 MiB, then the last 64 MiB, leaving the
middle untouched:

| point | RSS |
|---|---|
| declared, nothing touched | 1.6 MB |
| after touching FIRST 64 MiB | 67 MB |
| after touching LAST 64 MiB | **133 MB** |

So cgroup accounting charges the **sum of every distinct page ever touched** —
not the maximum of the regions, not the whole array. Untouched pages are never
charged; once an anonymous page is faulted in it stays charged (a judge box has
no swap, so nothing is reclaimed). Granularity is one page: touching a single
byte charges 4 KB. Note transparent hugepages are `madvise` on this host; under
`always`, a single byte could charge a 2 MB huge page and inflate sparse
patterns considerably.

**What `-m` and `--cg-mem` do together.** They are independent limits and both
are enforced — whichever binds first wins. Measured with a 128 MiB limit and a
program declaring 256 MiB:

| flags | declares 256 MiB, touches 0 | declares 256 MiB, touches 200 MiB |
|---|---|---|
| `-m` only (today) | killed, **signal 11**, `max-rss: 816 KB` | killed at startup, same |
| `--cg-mem` only | **runs fine** | killed, **signal 9**, `cg-mem` exactly at limit |
| both, equal | killed, **signal 11** (AS binds first) | killed at startup |
| `--cg-mem` limit + generous `-m` (1 G) | **runs fine** | killed, **signal 9** at exactly the limit |

**The decisive detail: signal 11 vs signal 9.** An address-space kill reports
SIGSEGV with `max-rss` of a few hundred KB — the process died having used almost
no memory, because the kernel refused the mapping, and *nothing in isolate's meta
indicates memory was the cause*. That is precisely why this repo has 555,119
`crash` verdicts and zero `memory_limit` ones. A cgroup kill reports SIGKILL with
`cg-mem` sitting exactly at the limit — unambiguous, and mappable to a proper `M`
verdict.

**Consequence for the policy debate:** "declaring `dp[5000][5000]` beyond the
limit should show MLE" is **not achievable through `-m`**. Address-space
enforcement can fail the program but can only ever report it as a crash. Wanting
both fail-on-declaration *and* an honest MLE verdict means `-m` cannot supply the
second half.

### Options

1. **Keep `-m` alone (status quo).** Your policy, but over-declaration keeps
   reading as "crash" and imported problems stay stricter than authored.
2. **Both flags, equal limits.** Byte-for-byte the same declaration behaviour as
   today, but a program that stays within address space and then over-uses gets a
   clean MLE. Strictly better reporting, zero loosening — the conservative fix.
3. **`--cg-mem` at the limit, `-m` generous (e.g. 4x).** Real memory overuse gets
   an accurate verdict; absurd declarations still fail fast; the common idiom
   (declare `MAXN`, use a submatrix) passes as it does on CMS/IOI/Codeforces.

Older framing kept below for reference:

1. **Keep cafe policy, fix the verdict.** Run with cgroups for accounting/reporting
   but keep an address-space cap too (`--cg-mem=<limit>` *and* `-m=<limit>`):
   students get a correct MLE verdict, and declaring beyond the limit still fails.
   Closest to today's behaviour while fixing Issue 2.
2. **Adopt CMS semantics** (`--cg-mem` only): full fidelity for imported problems,
   matches IOI convention. Strictly more permissive, so no existing grade can fall.
3. **Hybrid, per origin:** CMS semantics for imported problems, cafe semantics for
   native ones. Most faithful, but two grading models to explain and maintain —
   probably not worth it.
4. **Do nothing**, and raise imported problems' memory limits to compensate.

### Rollout requirement whichever is chosen

Use the existing Mode A replay harness (`problems:replay_validate`) to re-grade a
sample of **existing, non-imported** problems before/after and diff against stored
grades. Expect only `x -> P` transitions; **any `P -> x` means the page-cache
effect is real and stops the rollout.** Include tasks with large inputs. ~1 hour
of machine time; converts "should be safe" into "measured".

**Size:** the code change is one line (plus one more for the hybrid). The
decision and the verification are the work.

## Submission assist (Codey) — what is still open after the 2026-09-03 review

**Context.** Code review + prod-copy data pass over `Llm::CommentAssist` /
`CommentsController#llm_assist` on 2026-09-03; the deliverables (master
2084–2113, prompt `codey-core` v2.2 = `course-prep` rev 13) went live on
2026-09-05 — timeline in `doc/Assist-History.md`, study in
`doc/assist-corpus-eval-2026-09-03.md`. Follow-ups closed 2026-09-09: an
admin's request is free for the student (2116); per-model requests / points /
dollars / tokens on the user and problem stat pages (2117); Genie models off
the picker by default, relay kept as a backup (chula_cp 2118, config);
`codey-thai` kept as is (decided). All of it live on production 2026-09-10 15:51
(chula_cp 2123); the same day dae ran the clean-up script — 397 stuck
`processing` rows marked failed, token counts backfilled on 5,184 answers,
the dead `AI_viva` tag deleted. Still open:

### Measurement (after a term of the new payload + prompt)
- **Effectiveness re-measure**: assisted improved 36% / same 50% / reached 100
  18% before 2089, paired figure 27% → 38% (never quote the never-asked
  baseline). Re-run `frame.rb` / `frame2.rb` / `frame3.rb` (archived in
  `~/cafe-grader/assist-eval-2026-09-03/`, copies in `course-prep`) and compare
  read scores and outcomes against the 2026-09-03 document — compile-error and
  repeat-request cells first.
- **Gateway models unread.** claude-opus-4-5 (37 answers by 2026-09-03) and
  gemini-3.7-flash (26) were never read for quality; with Genie off the picker
  they are the whole roster. Read a sample once ~50 answers each exist. Ask OIT
  whether the Gateway can serve a Gemini Pro model — gemini-3.1-pro was 0/90
  wrong and is the model the v2.2 prompt was tested on.

### Prompt
- **TLE hand-over shape fix** (template or a second pass): the model names the
  allowed tool, then lays out the redesign anyway (6–7 of 18). The
  "name the tool then stop" rule made it worse (7 → 9/18, 2026-09-05) and was
  reverted; parked for a shape-level change plus a blind check.

**Size:** the prod steps are minutes; the Gateway read is a session; the TLE
fix is prompt authoring plus a blind check.

## Import/Export & CMS interop (from doc/problem-import-export-design-2026-07-14.md)

**Status 2026-08-02.** A *live-server* CMS import path shipped (master revs 1960–1968;
spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-02-cms-clone-import-design.md`):
`rails "cms:clone[task]"` ssh's to the CMS host, wraps the official `cmsDumpExporter`,
filters one task's subtree, fetches its blobs via `FileCacher`, and converts through
`Converters::CmsDumpConverter` into the trusted `ProblemImporter`. Validated against
c2 (`mar2025_eatingfish`): structure exact, and a replay of 8 real c2 submissions
scored 8/8 identical to CMS (only benign `T→P`/`x→P` per-testcase diffs). None of the
capability items below are closed by that work — Communication / OutputOnly / file-I/O
/ GroupMinPrereq are now *detected and rejected with a clear message* pointing here,
which is the interim behavior the 2026-07-14 design specified.

**Production transport that works today** (verified 2026-08-02, no new code needed):
clone on a box that has ssh to the CMS host → problem page **Download (all datasets)** →
upload that zip on the production server's existing **Problems → Import** page. Export→
import was round-tripped on the cloned problem: every field identical (both datasets,
42 testcases, weights, managers, statement, testcase bytes). This keeps production from
ever needing ssh/sudo access to the CMS host. Known cosmetic gap: the **live** dataset's
name is not preserved through a plain zip import (root `ds_name` is inert — the importer
auto-names the live dataset `Dataset N`; additional datasets keep their names). `cms:clone`
renames it explicitly; the web import path does not.

**Open, in the order that serves "import c2 → production, repeatably":**

- **UI-facing CMS *package* import (unbuilt).** The 2026-07-14 design's UI decision —
  "existing import page with format auto-detect" — is still unimplemented. Note the
  shape difference: `CmsDumpConverter` consumes a *dump bundle* produced by our own
  extractor, NOT a CMS-native package, so the upload path needs the originally-planned
  `CmsItalianConverter` (`task.yaml`) and/or `TpsConverter` (`problem.json`) plus
  sniffing in `problems_controller#do_import`. They slot into `app/engine/converters/`
  behind the same `convert(src, dest) → {log:, warnings:, errors:}` contract and can
  reuse the staging-layout knowledge (notably: a converter MUST emit `managers_dir` +
  `managers_pattern` or the importer silently skips `managers/*`). Needed when someone
  hands over a package file and there is no DB access; NOT needed for the c2→production
  flow above. Size: ~1 day per format + fixtures.
- **Mode B replay gate (CMS-source) before any bulk clone.** The 2026-08-02 validation
  was a hand-rolled script. Committing it as a CMS source mode in the existing
  `Replay::` harness (reuse `ReplayGrader`/`ReplayDiff`; new pieces are a CMS submission
  sampler and a CMS-outcome→cafe-verdict-char translator) turns per-task validation into
  one command. Matters because the 8-submission check only exercised white-diff +
  integer GroupMin + grader compilation; `Sum`, regex GroupMin params, and comparator
  (`custom_cms`) checkers have never been run against a real task. Size: ~half a day.
- Communication task support in the judge (manager process + FIFOs) — unblocks CMS Communication import/export.
- OutputOnly grading support — unblocks CMS OutputOnly import/export.
- GroupMinPrereq scoring in cafe's scorer (`score_param` to hold the prereq DAG) — unblocks importing dae's CMS camp tasks that use the custom score type.
- File-I/O task support (or a permanent-rejection decision) for Italian-format tasks with `infile`/`outfile`.
- Checker protocol adapter so `custom_cafe` checkers can be exported to CMS.
- C++ relative comparator (CMS-side equivalent of `lib/checker/relative.rb`).
- ✅ DONE 2026-07-19 — group-weight uniformity warning in the dataset UI
  (`Dataset#mixed_weight_groups`, shared with the import warning) and CMS-style
  codename-regex grouping in the Testcase config tool; the weight/group grammar
  and the CMS-divergence caveat are documented in `doc/dataset-scoring-and-evaluation.md`.
- Approach-C IR refactor of import/export — only if supported formats multiply beyond Italian+TPS.
- ✅ AUDITED 2026-07-19 — every single-string shell invocation on the grading path
  (`isolate_runner.rb`, `checker.rb:155`, `compiler/postgres.rb`, `judge_base.rb`,
  `grader.rb`). **Finding: no untrusted (student) input reaches any command
  string** — inputs are deployment config, engine-built ID paths, the
  admin-managed `languages` table, and problem-author files; authors already have
  arbitrary code execution by design (custom checkers run *unsandboxed* at
  `checker.rb:155`). Action taken: `judge_base.rb#run_initializer` → argv
  `system(*init_cmd)`. Optional hardening: `check_command` → argv, `${UID}` →
  `Process.uid` so `run_isolate` can drop the shell. **Separate larger item:**
  move custom checkers inside isolate if checkers are ever accepted from
  less-trusted authors.
- ✅ FIXED 2026-07-19 — `test/controllers/` and `test/integration/` must not declare
  the same class name (Ruby merges them and cross-contaminates `setup`); the
  integration file is now `report_controller_access_test.rb` /
  `ReportControllerAccessTest`. The rule stands for new test files.

## Near-Miss: student-facing phase (deliberately deferred)

Interaction model (staged ladder vs one-click AI repair vs mode-split),
lifeline economy via the existing `comments.cost` machinery,
GraderConfiguration budget keys. Deferred until the batch data is digested —
the contest-scale evidence now exists; see `doc/Near-Miss-Grading.md`
(experimental record + the max(original, repaired) policy) and spec
section 13 (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-30-near-miss-grading-design.md`).

---

## Near-Miss: `problems.statement_text` — designed 2026-07-31, deferred

Decision (dae): statements reach LLM prompts as **pdf-reader-extracted text**,
stored on the Problem as an **editable draft** (the `GroundingMaterial
#extraction_draft` pattern), because raw extraction drops Thai combining
marks and humans must be able to fix it once. Consumer: the ASSIST path
(unblocks `SelfHostAssist` in the picker) — NOT repair, which measured
better without statements. Integrity design (agreed after the
clobbering-vs-staleness discussion):

| Piece | Rule |
|---|---|
| `statement_text` (mediumtext) | machine draft or human-edited text |
| `statement_text_auto` (bool, default true) | true = safe to regenerate; any human form-save sets false |
| `statement_text_checksum` (string) | statement blob checksum the text was extracted from / edited against |
| Upload hook | re-extract ONLY if auto or blank — never clobber human edits |
| Problem form | textarea + staleness badge on checksum mismatch + explicit "Re-extract from PDF" button (resets auto) |

Plus: `pdf-reader` graduates into the Gemfile; blank extraction (scanned
PDFs) leaves the field blank and prompts omit the section; leave the column
out of the audited attrs (derived, bulky).

## CMS clone — deferred hardening batch (from 2026-08-02 final review)

- Nil CMS `time_limit`/`memory_limit` convert to `0` silently via `.to_f`/`.to_i`
  — add a reject-or-warn guard. `app/engine/converters/cms_dump_converter.rb:284-285`
  (`write_dataset_into`).
- Fractional `GroupMin` points truncate to an int weight with no warning —
  add a warn when `points` isn't a whole number.
  `app/engine/converters/cms_dump_converter.rb:172-202` (`build_group_plan`).
- `Errno::EPIPE` on the ssh stdin write surfaces as a raw backtrace instead
  of a clean `abort` — rescue it. `lib/tasks/cms.rake:36` (`stdin.write(File.read(script))`).
- Add `-o ConnectTimeout=10` to the ssh invocation so a dead/unreachable CMS
  host fails fast instead of hanging on the default TCP timeout.
  `lib/tasks/cms.rake:31` (the `ssh -o BatchMode=yes ...` cmd array).
- An empty ACTIVE dataset (0 testcases) imports with no warning — give it
  root parity with the additional-dataset warning path (non-active empty
  datasets already get a `skipped non-active dataset` warning via
  `dataset_reject_reasons`; the active one has no equivalent signal).
  `app/engine/converters/cms_dump_converter.rb:127-147` (`dataset_reject_reasons`),
  `:327` (the per-dataset testcase-count log line).
- `script/cms_extract/extract_task.py`'s module docstring documents exit
  codes `0 ok, 2 usage, 3 task not found` but not the traceback/exit-1 case
  for an unhandled exception (e.g. `cmsDumpExporter` failure) — the rake
  task already treats any nonzero exit as failure so behavior is correct,
  just undocumented. `script/cms_extract/extract_task.py:1-21` (docstring).

## Contest stop does not finish open viva sessions

**Raised 2026-09-12 from the Quiz 1 postmortem** (`doc/exam-postmortem-2026-09-09-d69_q1.md` F5). When `d69_q1` stopped at
11:20, 65 of 151 answered viva sessions were still open (no End, no `[[VIVA_DONE]]`, under the hard cap) and were
finalised by 62 manual Re-run grading clicks over 36 minutes; otherwise the 24 h abandoned-session reaper would have graded
them the next day. Proposed: when a contest's stop (plus per-user extra time) passes, queue grading for every open viva
session on that contest's viva problems that has at least one student turn, and archive greeting-only ones — the same two
branches as `Submission.reap_abandoned_vivas!`, keyed on the contest window instead of 24 h of inactivity. Belongs with
Phase B (per-contest retakes) in `doc/Viva-Exam.md`.

**Decision 2026-09-17 (dae): not automatic — a batch button.** No contest-stop
trigger. Instead an admin control on the contest page (`contests/show`) —
"Finish open viva sessions" — that runs the two branches above once, on click,
over every open session of that contest's viva problems: queue grading for
sessions with at least one student turn, archive greeting-only ones, and toast
the two counts. Same window/offset logic as `Contest#submissions`; Flavor A
`button_to` with a `turbo-confirm`. The 24 h reaper stays as the safety net.

## Waiting for a signal

Decided, not deprioritized: each of these stays closed until its **Reopen
when** condition is met. Reviewed 2026-09-02 with dae.

### Help drawers — first-visit popover on the `? Help` trigger

**Settled (2026-05-17, CLAUDE.md "Frontend & UI Conventions"):** two help
patterns coexist on purpose — inline knowledge card on index/overview pages,
offcanvas drawer on edit/detail pages — and the drawer trigger is a *labeled*
`? Help` button, never icon-only. Shared drawer layout
(`shared/_help_drawer.html.haml`, 2026-07-01) and the accordion edit drawer
(`problems/_edit_help`, 2026-07-19) are done. `app/views/main/help.html.haml`
(student-facing, i18n) is a different concern.

**Not built:** a first-visit popover pointing at the trigger, on the
cookie-based `dismiss-announcement` controller pattern. The hypothesis is that
the visible label alone is enough discoverability.

**Reopen when:** there is evidence the label is not enough — admins asking
where the help is, or drawers that measurably never get opened. Not a date.

### Grounding materials — three follow-ups deferred by the 2026-07-19 design

**Settled (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-19-viva-grounding-materials-design.md`,
reaffirmed 2026-07-20, re-filed here 2026-09-12 with dae):** `GroundingMaterial`
is its own model with the Manage → Grounding library and a viva-only attach
select (`doc/Viva-Exam.md` §3); `llm_prompt` stays a `Tag` kind with exactly one
consumer (`comment_assist.rb`); grounding files are PDF-only; the ≈token figure
is a byte-size proxy (`BYTES_PER_PROXY_TOKEN = 400`) shown for information only.

**Not built, on purpose:**
- (a) one shared LLM-asset model for `llm_prompt` tags and grounding materials
  (alternative C in the spec) — would let `Tag` become a pure label table, for
  no benefit today.
- (b) a `pdf-reader` page count behind `GroundingMaterial#compute_estimated_tokens`
  — nothing gates on the number; it appears only in the library table, the viva
  form line "Attached grounding ≈ N tokens — re-sent every turn" and the kit
  importer log.
- (c) image grounding files. v1 originally accepted png/jpeg/webp at upload, but
  `Llm::Request.encode_pdf_part` only emits PDFs, so an image was accepted,
  token-counted and silently never sent; `ALLOWED_CONTENT_TYPES` was narrowed to
  PDF. Adding images back means extending BOTH the validation list AND the
  encoder (a sibling emitting a plain `data:image/png;base64,…` part) in the
  same change — either alone reintroduces the silent drop.

**Reopen when:** (a) the prompt tag needs files or per-item token budgeting;
(b) the shown ≈token number misleads a real decision about what to attach;
(c) a course actually wants a diagram or slide image as grounding. None of
these has happened.

### `ai_gateway:` holds ONE gateway — no second bearer-key gateway side by side

`Llm::AiGatewayTransport.gateway_config` (`app/services/llm/ai_gateway_transport.rb`)
reads a single `Rails.configuration.llm[:ai_gateway]` block, so a deployment
runs exactly one bearer-key gateway. Running two concurrently — the Chula AI
Gateway *and* an OpenRouter-style aggregator held as a fallback for when a
model retires or the proxy wobbles — needs `ai_gateway:` generalized into a
keyed registry shaped like `self_hosted_models:`, plus a provider class per
entry so the admin pickers can tell the two rosters apart. Size: medium —
config shape, initializer wiring, per-entry provider classes, picker plumbing.

**Not built (2026-08-30):** this is the YAGNI half of the old "OpenRouter LLM
provider" entry. Nobody runs two gateways today, and a single-gateway
deployment is fully served by the current block — *including* a downstream
site whose only gateway is OpenRouter. The other half (provider-agnostic cost
+ a documented recipe) shipped at rev 2050; see Resolved.

**Reopen when:** a second *concurrent* gateway is actually wanted — a
fallback aggregator to run beside the Chula AI Gateway, a second provider the
pickers must tell apart, or a deployment that needs two bearer-key gateways.
Adding a new provider that *replaces* the current one is not a signal; the
existing block already handles that with a config change.

## Resolved

Pointer blocks only — newest first. Full write-ups: `hg log`, CHANGELOG, linked docs.

### `viva:import` updated `viva_prompt` on prod without an audit row — RESOLVED 2026-09-17

Root cause (reproduced with a dev-DB probe and `test/models/auditable_test.rb`):
`Auditable` read `saved_changes` in `after_update_commit`, but `reload` clears
it — and `KitImporter#post_check` reloads every touched problem inside the
import transaction, so the commit callback saw an empty diff and returned. The
same read also mis-reported two other shapes: several saves of one record in
one transaction logged only the last save's fields, and a record created then
updated in one transaction got a create row carrying only the update's field
(`create_problem` does exactly that with `live_dataset`). Fix, rev 2157 (chula_cp
2158): the concern stages the tracked `saved_changes` in `after_save` and writes
them at commit — first old / last new per field, changed-and-changed-back
dropped, `after_rollback` discards the staging, and a save under
`AuditLog.paused` stages nothing (pausing inside an outer transaction used to
leak the row at commit). The importer is unchanged; its reload is legitimate.
`description` joined `Problem`'s audited list, stored in full (max 6 KB on
prod). Tests: 6 new concern tests + 1 importer test asserting one `update` row
naming `description` and `viva_prompt` (redacted) with the rake's actor note.

### Deploy has no automatic post-deploy grading check — RESOLVED 2026-09-17

Shipped web rev 2155 (master; chula_cp merge 2156) + automation rev 63. The
entry's `--pick` option: `EngineSmokePicker` (`app/engine/engine_smoke_picker.rb`)
chooses the submission on each host — done, regular (no near-miss shadow),
non-viva, full score, C++ then C then Python, slowest testcase ≤ 50 % of the
time limit (no P↔T flips), graded after the live dataset and its testcases
last changed (the stored grade is against the dataset the run uses),
testcases × limit ≤ 60 s, most recent first (its blobs are still on disk).
`bin/rails engine:smoke SUB=auto` runs it and prints `SKIPPED` (exit 0) on a
web-only host (no enabled `GraderProcess` rows) or when nothing qualifies, so
neither blocks a deploy; explicit `SUB=<id>` never skips. The deploy job runs
it right after `assets:precompile` and BEFORE the Solid Queue / Passenger /
`Grader.restart` steps: `set -e` aborts the remote script on exit 1 (engine
error) or 2 (verdict differs), leaving the long-lived graders on the old code.
The two hand scripts (`~/cafe-grader/deploy_cedt.sh`, `deploy-cp-grader.sh`)
carry the same line. Checked on the dev prod-copy DB: picked a 10-testcase
C++ submission in 2.6 s; the run itself 404s locally because the testcase
blobs exist only on the servers (10 attached in DB, 0 files under `storage/`)
— the very failure the recency rule avoids on a host. Tests:
`test/engine/engine_smoke_picker_test.rb` (10). Residual: the entry's third
option, a never-deleted smoke problem seeded per host, was not built — the
`SKIPPED` path covers a fresh host, and a real host always has recent
full-score C++.

### `jobs.status` has no index, and the judge polls it at 5 Hz per grader — RESOLVED 2026-09-08

Shipped rev 2115: migration `AddStatusPriorityIdIndexToJobs` adds
`(status, priority DESC, id)` — leading column for `Job.has_waiting_job` and
`Job.reclaim_orphaned!`, full key for `take_oldest_waiting_job`'s sort with
no filesort — and `Job.clean_old_job` now also purges `error` rows after 30
days (they were never deleted; on 2026-09-08 comprog carried 4,422 and cedt
1,301 dead rows from the 2026-08-30 outage, all "Output file … does not
exists"). Measured first, as the entry asked, on a `CREATE TABLE … LIKE jobs`
copy in the dev DB (MySQL 8.0.46, 128 MB pool, fsync per commit, like prod),
1,000 ops each and an 8-grader drain of 1,200 jobs with the real 0.2 s
empty-claim sleep:

| | 33k no index | 33k index | 200k no index | 200k index |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| idle poll | 2.31 ms | 0.15 ms | 13.6 ms | 0.15 ms |
| claim (select for update + flip) | 13.9 ms | 2.70 ms | 67.0 ms | 2.55 ms |
| insert / report | 2.2 ms / 2.2 ms | 2.1 ms / 2.4 ms | 2.3 ms / 2.2 ms | 2.1 ms / 2.2 ms |
| drain, 8 graders | 18.7 s | 5.5 s | 55.0 s | 5.5 s |
| empty claims of 1,200 | 353 | 0 | 655 | 0 |
| `ADD INDEX` | — | 100 ms | — | 443 ms |

The decisive finding was not speed but locking: under REPEATABLE READ the
unindexed `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` claim locks every row it scans, so a
concurrent grader's claim returns nothing (it then sleeps 0.2 s) and web-tier
job inserts wait behind the claim. With the index SKIP LOCKED does what the
2023 "start new judge" commit added it for. Write cost of the index was not
measurable — each insert/update is dominated by the commit's log flush.
Production shape that day: grader-2023 ~27k jobs/day, ~33k rows resident
after the nightly trim, 8 graders on 10.0.5.81. Same day on prod: duplicate
crontab cleanup lines removed from .50/.52/.80 (Solid Queue recurring owns
both cleanups there; the cron `cleanup_judge` on .81 stays — the worker runs
no Solid Queue). Residual: prod's dead `error` rows go on the first nightly
run after deploy; toi was unreachable over ssh and unchecked.

### Viva `answer` action — concurrent at-cap POSTs can double-enqueue the grade job — RESOLVED 2026-09-06

Shipped rev 2114. `#answer` and `#finish` (the same three lines: closing turn,
`:evaluating`, grade job) now run their check-and-transition inside
`@submission.with_lock` and enqueue after the block commits; the shared step
is `#force_finish!`. The same lock closes the below-cap variant too — two
answers landing together used to record two student turns and two assist
jobs. Regression tests: the three "concurrent" tests in
`test/integration/viva_sessions_controller_test.rb`, which play the
first-committed request through a one-shot hook on `Submission#lock!`.
Residual: `#retry_turn` and `#restart` are still lock-free — a double-click
on Retry can run one turn's LLM call twice (the second result overwrites the
first), and Restart can archive a session just as an answer lands. Cost and
nuisance only, no grading path; reopen if either shows up in transcripts.
Timeline entry: `doc/Viva-History.md` 2026-09-06.

### Problem stat page — slow page + "By group" card — RESOLVED 2026-09-03

Shipped rev 2081, both halves together as the entry proposed. `Problem#attempt_summary`
and `Problem#group_stats_for(user)` (`app/models/problem.rb`) replace the Ruby
loop over every submission (the 65-day histogram it also built was displayed
nowhere and is gone); the submissions table is filled by `problems#stat_query`
(JSON, jbuilder) and paged client-side with deferred rendering. The
"established server-side pattern" the entry pointed at (`process_query_record`)
turned out to have no callers, so the table follows the Submission report's
pattern instead. Measured on the prod-copy dev DB, heaviest problem (7,825
subs): page server work ~1.2 s of Ruby → ~0.4 s of SQL, rows (~0.2 s) fetched
separately after paint, no 7,825-row HTML. Card: members (enabled `user` role
only), solved / attempted, solved %, mean best over attempted, row links to the
Best Score report pre-filtered to the group; the distinct-user summary is kept
separate so multi-group students don't make the page contradict itself.
Rev 2082 (dae, 2026-09-03: "we have lots of groups"): prod-copy numbers are
median 5 / p90 9 / max 13 linked groups per problem, growing by the archived
cohorts each semester, so archived groups fold behind a toggle while live ones
stay open; tabs were rejected because they hide the comparison the card exists
for. Tests: `test/models/problem_group_stats_test.rb`, additions to
`test/controllers/problems_stat_controller_test.rb`, `test/system/problem_stat_test.rb`.
Residual: the remaining ~0.4 s is MySQL reading wide `submissions` rows through
the `problem_id` index; a covering index `(problem_id, repaired_from_id, user_id, points)`
would cut it further if a problem ever feels slow again. True server-side
paging (`serverSide: true`) stays an option past ~50k submissions.

### `datatables/configs.js` render functions interpolate unescaped HTML — RESOLVED 2026-09-02

Shipped rev 2079, wider than the entry asked for. The audit showed the entry
understated it: every plain `{data: 'field'}` column in every JSON-fed
DataTable rendered markup (DataTables writes cells with innerHTML), a
self-registered user sets their own full name, and the login-failure report
shows the raw attempted-login string — stored XSS from a student or an
anonymous visitor to an admin, not admin-on-admin. Fix:
`cafe.dt.escape_columns_by_default` (`app/javascript/cafe_datatable.js`) on
every JSON-fed `columns` array — the `datatables--init` controller plus nine
inline tables — and `escapeHtml` on the custom renderers' free-text
interpolations; DOM-sourced tables untouched. Regression: system tests on the
contest and group user tables (`<b>`, `<img onerror>` in a full name → text,
no element, handler never runs). Rule for new tables recorded in CLAUDE.md
(Admin DataTables). Residual: none known.

### Upstream GitHub Pages for docs/ — RESOLVED 2026-08-31

**Rev 2070 (pointer swaps; the switch itself was a GitHub setting).** jittat
enabled Pages on cafe-grader-team (Deploy from a branch, `master` + `/docs`);
verified `status: built` and both the index and `guide/authorization.html`
serving 200 over HTTPS. Same day the three pointers moved to
`https://cafe-grader-team.github.io/cafe-grader-web/…`: the upstream wiki
`Users-Roles-and-Access-Control` companion block (fork-hosting caveat
trimmed), `README.md`'s Guides-site link (rev 2070), and the fork wiki
`Home.md` "temporarily published" sentence. Residuals: upstream's README copy
catches up at the next `/upstream-sync` batch; "Enforce HTTPS" is unticked
(cosmetic, jittat's toggle); the per-repo About-field wording idea from the
old entry stays unasked-for and lives only here.

### Jobs stuck in `:process` forever when a grader dies mid-job — RESOLVED 2026-08-30

**Rev 2060.** `Job.reclaim_orphaned!` returns jobs whose grader claimed them and
never reported back. Two callers, deliberately different in how each proves the
grader is gone: `Grader.watchdog` passes the ids of boxes its own `ps` sweep
just found empty — proof, not a timeout, so a merely-slow grader can never have
its job taken away — and a `grader_job_reclaim` recurring task
(`config/recurring.yml`, every 10 min, `older_than: 30.minutes`, production
only) sweeps fleet-wide for the case the ps path structurally cannot cover: a
host whose watchdog is itself not running.

**The part that needed deciding was not detection but what to do with an old
one.** Requeueing is safe in the abstract — compile/evaluate/score are all
re-runnable and `Evaluation` is `find_or_create_by` per (submission, testcase) —
but the prod-copy dev DB held **126 stranded jobs, the oldest 564 days**, from a
worker that died 2025-08-04; ten of their eleven submissions had since been
hand-rejudged to `done`. Blind requeueing would have silently regraded
year-old submissions and, for those, failed anyway: `Grader.cleanup_web` purges
the compiled binary `Evaluator#prepare_executable` re-downloads. So a job is
dead-lettered to `:error` rather than requeued when its submission already
reached a `Submission::GRADING_FINAL_STATUSES`, when it is older than
`Job::MAX_RECLAIM_AGE` (24 h), or after `RECLAIM_ATTEMPT_LIMIT` reclaims —
sharing the `"retry N"` counter `Grader#check_and_run_job` already parses, so a
job that keeps killing graders cannot loop forever. A still-mid-flight
submission is marked `grader_error`, which is what stops a student seeing
"evaluating" forever and puts it on the normal Rejudge path.

Also: `Grader#initialize` now writes `pid`/`host` on the `GraderProcess` row —
the columns existed but only the dead legacy `register_grader` ever set them.
Nothing depends on the value; the watchdog still identifies processes from `ps`.

Tests: `test/models/job_reclaim_test.rb` (11). Dry-run against the 126 real rows
inside a rolled-back transaction: 0 requeued, 126 dead-lettered, **0 submissions
touched**. **Residual:** the missing `jobs.status` index, now its own open entry
above. Not covered: the narrow window where a grader dies *after* `Job#report`
but *before* `add_evaluation_jobs` / `add_scoring_job` — the job is `:success`,
so no `:process` sweep can see it, and the chain still stalls.

### OpenRouter LLM provider — RESOLVED 2026-08-30 (generic path hardened, recipe documented)

**Rev 2050.** The entry asked for an OpenRouter provider; the generic one had
already landed (`Llm::AiGatewayTransport`, rev 2018), so what was actually
missing was (a) cost resolution that does not assume LiteLLM and (b) a recipe a
downstream operator can follow. Both shipped. **No OpenRouter-specific code
path exists, and none is wanted** — pointing the `ai_gateway:` block at it is
configuration.

- `compute_cost` resolves header → `usage.cost` in the response body → `0.0`
  **at WARN**. The silent zero was the real defect and was never
  OpenRouter-specific: cost tracking off on the proxy, a model missing from
  LiteLLM's price map, or an upgrade dropping the header each recorded $0.00
  into `Comment.cost_summary_for` and the near-miss lifeline budget with no
  signal at all. `execute_call` now keeps the raw header string, so a genuine
  `0` stays authoritative instead of falling through.
- New optional `ai_gateway.usage_in_body` sends `usage: {include: true}`, which
  is what makes a body-reporting gateway emit cost. Off by default: LiteLLM has
  no such key and would forward the unknown field upstream.
- **The trap worth remembering** (measured, not assumed): `execute_call` POSTs
  an *absolute* path and Faraday resolves it against `base_url` with URI-join
  semantics, so an absolute path REPLACES the prefix's path —
  `https://openrouter.ai/api` + `/v1/chat/completions` silently becomes
  `https://openrouter.ai/v1/chat/completions` (404). The documented recipe keeps
  `base_url` bare and puts the whole `/api/v1/...` in `completion_path`. LiteLLM
  proxies mount at the root and are unaffected.
- Worked OpenRouter block in `config/llm.yml`, explicitly labelled UNVERIFIED on
  the two points that need a live account: the exact `usage.cost` opt-in, and
  whether OpenRouter accepts the OpenAI `file` content part that
  `convert_pdf_parts` emits for PDFs (built and tested against LiteLLM; only
  viva grounding and statement PDFs depend on it).

Tests: `test/services/llm/ai_gateway_transport_test.rb` — header wins over body,
a genuine header `0` is authoritative and does not warn, body fallback for
string *and* symbol keys, the loud zero, and `usage_in_body` off / on /
caller-supplied. **Residual:** the multi-gateway registry, now its own open
entry above.

### `custom_cms` checker argv order on LIVE problems — RESOLVED 2026-08-29 (no mis-grading)

**Verified on production (10.0.5.50), rev 2046.** All 10 problems on the legacy
argv order — `custom_cms` 570 `d68_q3a_jobqueue`, 606 `a68_q1a_horse`, 656
`a68_q4z_guitar_array3`, 659 `a68_q4a_normal_puzzle`, and `custom_cms_raw`
649–654 `rubiks_race_1..6` (one shared binary) — expect cafe's
`(input, USER, correct)` order, so `Checker#check_command` invokes them
correctly and no submission was mis-graded. Method: pulled each checker and its
real testcase blobs, ran them locally with crafted content in slot 2 vs slot 3
(empty / garbage / the reference / a valid solution); in every checker the
verdict tracks slot 2 only and slot 3 is ignored even when it holds garbage
(656 is a Python script reading `argv[2]` as the student grid; 659 accepted a
valid `1L 2L` solution in slot 2 with `1.0` and rejected it in slot 3 — its
`main` constructs an `ifstream` on `argv[3]` and never reads it). Cross-check
from production data: students hold full-score `PPPP…` runs on all ten although
the stored reference answers are placeholders (570 a fixed token; 659 and
650–654 a byte-copy of the input) that a CMS-order checker would have graded
*as the student's output* and failed universally. **The `strings` proxy in the
original entry is wrong** — all five print `translate:*` (CMS *result*
protocol, exactly as `doc/Checker-and-Auxiliary-Files.md` teaches) yet take
testlib argv order; output vocabulary says nothing about argv order. Durable
record: `doc/decisions.md` 2026-08-29; loud naming-trap warnings now sit in
`doc/Checker-and-Auxiliary-Files.md` (plus a `cms_comparator` section that was
missing), `doc/dataset-scoring-and-evaluation.md`, `doc/CMS-Migration.md` §5.3.
**Residual — DONE rev 2047 (2026-08-30):** (a) renamed `custom_cms` →
`custom_testlib`, `custom_cms_raw` → `custom_testlib_raw` (integers unchanged;
`Dataset::LEGACY_EVALUATION_TYPES` aliases the old names on assignment); (b)
`cms_comparator` exposed in the dataset dropdown as **[CMS-NATIVE]**. Fleet census
(8 servers) in `doc/decisions.md` 2026-08-29 update; TOI-box `may2025_abcd` was
the one true CMS-order checker → `cms_comparator` + rejudge.

### Grader.watchdog duplicate-spawn → isolate box collisions (`!` results) — RESOLVED 2026-08-29

**Rev 2045 + automation rev 58.** Incident 2026-08-27 on the ISE grader
(10.0.5.70): two orphaned whenever crontab blocks (identified by the
schedule.rb path; the app dir had been renamed) ran two watchdogs per minute,
both spawned per box, and `lines.count >= 1` read the pair as healthy —
isolate "This box is currently in use" → `!` on ~130 submissions that day
(bursts Jun 23–29 and Jul 17 too); hosts deduped by hand the same day.
Code: `Grader.watchdog` takes a host-wide non-blocking flock
(`Dir.tmpdir/cafe-grader-watchdog-<worker_id>.lock`), parses
`ps -o pid,ppid,etimes,args` via `Grader.grader_processes` (every grader is
an `sh -c` → Ruby chain; the wrapper is collapsed and the Ruby leaf signalled),
and `Grader.plan_box` TERMs every duplicate but the oldest — TERM, never
KILL, see the stuck-jobs entry — and stops *all* processes of a disabled box
(was: first pid only); duplicate kills go to `Rails.logger.warn`. Rerun
idempotency: `JudgeBase#prepare_testcase_directory` `rm_f`s the previous
`stdout.txt` (a run that died with its box left it 0644/other-uid; a rerun on
another box could not truncate it — 14 of 142 rejudges on 08-27). Deploy: CI
runs `whenever --clear-crontab` (drops the legacy path-identified block,
no-op after) then `whenever --update-crontab cafe-grader`. Tests
`test/engine/grader_watchdog_test.rb`. Not done: retry on isolate `XX`
(cause removed). TOI box (10.24.0.100) crontab checked 2026-08-30: a single
watchdog block (no cleanup jobs). Follow-up rev 2053: the spawn itself leaked
fds — the spawner's mysql2 socket and RVM's fd 6 (a login-shell copy of
stderr; sshd's stderr pipe under the deploy pipeline) — so the CI-driven
`Grader.restart` (automation rev 59) hung every deploy job after
"Successfully deployed"; graders now spawn with `in: /dev/null` +
`close_others: true` (`Grader.grader_spawn_options`, tested).

### Viva grading: harden against transcript-continuation failures — RESOLVED 2026-08-29

**Revs 2024 + 2043.** (a) Prompt hardening, rev 2024: `INTERVIEWER:`/`STUDENT:`
transcript labels + trailing `=== END OF TRANSCRIPT ===` re-anchor (Claude
compliance 3/24 → 16/16, Gemini unaffected). (b) Silent nil-score grades, rev
2043: the hole was `extract_json_object` returning the first balanced `{…}` and
the write path trusting it — not "no JSON", which has raised since rev 1667.
`grade_schema_error` (numeric `total_points` 0..100, non-empty `rubric`) and
unparseable brace blocks now raise `ResponseError`; `VivaGradeAssist#respond`
(new `Llm::Request#respond` template) re-asks once — not on
`finish_reason=length` — then the existing `grader_error` path (red admin alert,
`llm_response_raw` = last body, first bad reply at WARN, Re-run picker); both
attempts' cost on the grade row. Tests `test/services/llm/viva_grade_assist_test.rb`.
(c) Interview/narrative language is a **conduct-tag** concern, not code: DS kit
`_conduct.md` §Language (examiner English-only, students Thai/English/mixed,
translation → simpler English, narrative in the student's language), deployed
as prod `viva_conduct` tag 38 and verified identical 2026-08-29; convention
recorded in `doc/Viva-Exam.md` §2.
Grader model history: gemini-2.5-flash → 3.1-pro (chula_cp rev 2008; 12-session
comparison on 10.0.5.50 `~/viva_compare_results.jsonl`) → 3.7-flash via the Chula
AI Gateway (2026-08-27 bake-off, `~/cafe-grader/bakeoff-2026-08-27/report.html`);
rev 2011 made both end paths use the grade service's default.
**Residual (policy, ~$1):** re-test `claude-opus-4-5` as grader with the hardened
prompt on all 12 sessions — strictest and most consistent (spread ≤4) in the
4-session probe; strict-vs-generous on uncovered rubric items is the instructor's
call before any exam-graded viva.

### API ↔ web parity: IP whitelist not enforced on `/api/v1` — RESOLVED 2026-08-28

**Rev 2026.** Full web parity: one predicate `User#allowed_from_ip?` backs the web
gate, a per-request 403 in `Api::V1::BaseController#authenticate_api_user!`, and
token-issuance refusal in `auth/login`; CIDR matching lives in
`GraderConfiguration.whitelisted_ip?`. Tests: `authorization_sweep_spec.rb`
(whitelist sweep over every `/api/v1` route), `authorization_spec.rb`,
`test/models/grader_configuration_test.rb`. CHANGELOG 4.5.0.

### Viva grade display — narrative doesn't belong in `grader_comment` / main list — RESOLVED 2026-08-28

**Rev 2036 (4.5.0 head).** Success path writes `Submission#viva_result_marker`
(`viva` / `viva:terminated`, from `viva_terminated_at`) to `grader_comment`; the
narrative lives on `viva_grades.narrative` only. `_submission_short` shows a
badge-as-link for viva rows plus "Interview in progress" / "Grading in
progress…" / red "Grader error" states. One-off cleanup
`bin/rails viva:clean_grader_comments [APPLY=1]` (`Viva::GraderCommentCleaner`,
report-first). Record: CHANGELOG 4.5.0, `doc/Viva-Exam.md`.

### Viva/tag markdown fields are bare textareas — add highlighting + preview — RESOLVED 2026-08-28

**Rev 2030.** `markdown_editor_controller.js` (Ace `mode-markdown`, `github`
theme, soft wrap) wraps all four textareas via
`ApplicationHelper#markdown_editor_data`, with an Edit / Preview toggle →
`POST /markdown/preview` (`safe_markdown`, editors only); `grounding-draft`
dispatches `change` so "Copy draft into Body" still works. Not done by design:
side-by-side preview, client-side renderer.

### Viva problem edit page — right column is empty, left column crammed — RESOLVED 2026-08-28

**Rev 2031.** One form over both columns: Detail card left, Viva Exam card right
(Scenario + briefing full width, then interview setup). Hint and Description tabs
dropped for viva problems; `form=` rejected because Rails does not propagate it
to a multiple select's hidden input. Type switches redraw `#problem-edit` on
save; a dataset-less problem gets an "Add dataset" empty state.

### Reporter role: let it report on finished (unavailable / archived) courses — RESOLVED 2026-07-01

**Option 3b.** Editors are group-scoped content curators:
`Problem.group_editable_by_user` dropped the `available` / `groups.enabled`
filters, `group_reportable_by_user` = editor-set ∪ reporter-gated-set, and
`Group.reportable_by_user` is role-aware — an editor sees/edits/reports on
archived courses and draft problems in their groups; reporters stay scoped to
live content. **Operational rule:** to give a non-admin access to a finished
course, make them an *editor* of its group. Option B (scores-only split) not
taken. Tests `test/models/problem_scope_authorization_test.rb`; the role model is
documented in `doc/Users-Roles-and-Access-Control.md` / the upstream wiki page
and superseded in detail by `doc/decisions.md` 2026-08-22.

### Publish "Users, Roles & Access Control" wiki page — RESOLVED 2026-07-01

Live at https://github.com/cafe-grader-team/cafe-grader-web/wiki/Users-Roles-and-Access-Control
(wiki commit `54b2c8d`). Source draft: `doc/Users-Roles-and-Access-Control.md` —
edit here, then re-push to the separate wiki repo
(`git@github.com:cafe-grader-team/cafe-grader-web.wiki.git`). Wiki `Home.md` is
intentionally minimal (GitHub's auto sidebar lists pages).

### AuditLog destroy test — RESOLVED 2026-06-20

`test/models/auditable_test.rb` (4 tests): own-row destroy writes a `destroy`
row, the `dependent: :destroy` cascade writes rows for `ContestProblem` /
`ContestUser`, the snapshot stores `[value, nil]`, `AuditLog.paused` suppresses.
Confirms `after_destroy_commit` fires under transactional tests.

### CSRF meta null-safety in DataTable inits — RESOLVED 2026-06-20

`?.` on every `meta[name="csrf-token"]` lookup — 5 view sites plus 4 in the
shared `datatables/configs.js`; a grep for the unguarded form returns nothing.
Rule codified in CLAUDE.md "Testing Notes" (the unguarded form throws when
forgery protection is off and silently kills the whole DataTable).

### System-test suite — RESOLVED 2026-06-15

`bin/rails test:system` 46/46 green (was 20 failing on 2026-05-21). Six root-cause
clusters, none of them production regressions: the no-spaces `name` rule is
intentional (`NameFormatValidator`, human text goes in `description`) — tests
fixed, not the rule; `select2_select` helper scoped to the open widget with
`exact_text`; async turbo_stream submits raced the DB read — wait for `.toast`;
submissions "Go" button replaced by the select2 chooser; users-page drift
(unguarded CSRF meta, redirect target, grant-admin select2, `f.button :submit`).
Two tests skipped on hunches were both wrong diagnoses and are un-skipped. All
lessons live in CLAUDE.md "Testing Notes". Leftover UI question: the user-edit
page's second submit button outside the form via `form=`.
